        <template>In response to current restrictions created by the COVID-19 health crisis, the Professional Master's Program has temporarily waived the GRE requirement until the Autumn 2022 application cycle. 
        Applicants to an earlier quarter do not need to provide official GRE scores. 
        The only exception to this requirement is for candidates who have a Ph.D. from a U.S. institution. Average GRE scores for applicants accepted into the PMP are: 
        Quantitative 83% (strong applicants who score above 65% can still be considered  and occasionally those who score below 65% in the Quantitative test are accepted.); 
        Analytical 4.5 (this is a distant second in importance to the Quantitative test so lower scores can still be considered), 
        and Verbal 60% (those with English as a first language should target over 50%, those with English as a second language should target over 25%). 
        There is no minimum GRE score. If your GRE scores are lower than average (especially Analytical and Verbal scores), you will still be considered especially if you have above-average academic or professional credentials
